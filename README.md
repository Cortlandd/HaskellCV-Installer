# Under Construction


This is a script I wish to hopefully be used to install OpenCV 3.1.0 and LumiGuide/Haskell-OpenCV on Ubuntu in one install. I choose LumiGuide's binding because its the best and actively maintained. Its also the first big Haskell project I've done an official contribution to. :D

_Plus this will be a good chance to learn some shell scripting._
